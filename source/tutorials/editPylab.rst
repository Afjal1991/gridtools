Edit a grid mask with pylab
===========================

The pylab grid mask editor was initially written for the
ROMS ocean model.  It has been ported to gridtools and
will operate on ROMS grids.  The editor needs to be
updated to work more efficiently with ROMS and MOM6
grids.

See ":ref:`pylab-mask-editor`" for instructions on how
to launch the tool.  The function call to write the
ROMS grid is the same as the pyroms tool.
