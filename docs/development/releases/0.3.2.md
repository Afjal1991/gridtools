# General Release Notes

 - This release resolves issues #15 and #16 with fixes to spherical grid support and
   the ability to extend a model grid for use in routines that generate artifacts on
   the boundaries.

# Bug Fixes

 - Fix example7 scripts so they can run independently of each other as examples.
 - `gridtools.generate_regional_spherical_meters` fix spherical grid generation.  Resolves #16
 - app: adjust grid center latitude bounds to -90 to +90. Resolves #16.

# API Changes

 - For some examples, the **i** verticies are now shown in yellow to show orientation of the grid and
   to make sure the grid orientation is correct as requested.
 - Updates to computeBathymeticRoughness()
   - Option FixByOverlapQHGridShift replaced with two boolean arguments: useQHGridShift, useOverlap 

# Contributors

 - Jessica Garwood, Kate Hedstrom: debugging and confirmation of problems generating MOM6 exchange
   grids using xarray or gridtools.
