# General Release Notes

 - Adopt MOM6 license for the gridtools library.
 - Add the ability for basic plotting of a single variable.
 - Add the ability to write out FMS mosaic files.
   - Given `MINIMUM_DEPTH`, `MAXIMUM_DEPTH` and `MASKING_DEPTH`, the
     appropropriate masks are written to the exchange grids for
     `tile1` for any given bathymetry grid.
 - Ability to generate a topography/bathymetry grid from any
   data source.
 - Ability to generate a topography/bathymetry grid from any
   data source and generate a roughness parameter (h2) using
   a mesh refinement method.
 - Add the ability to convert a ROMS model grid to a MOM6
   model grid.
 - Use sphinx as the documentation pathway for the python
   library.
 - HTML and PDF documentation rendered to
   https://mom6gridtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
 - Add cluster notes for chinook@UAF and triton@RU.
 - Add installation notes on RasPi4, an aarch64 platform type for independent comparisons.
 - References to papers and code being relocated to a central bibtex file used by sphinx (WIP).
 - Fixing up references to previously implemented code (WIP).
 - Remove extraneous whitespace.
 - Implement a catalog system for data sources (WIP).  It should not interfere with using
   files directly on a local system.  Allow experimentation with alternate DAP service.

# Bug fixes
 
 - In the application, saving a remote file now goes to
   the specified filename and directory.
 - Pin version of python docutils to 0.16 to fix rendering
   of bullet items.

# API changes

 - Use openGrid()/readGrid() to open and read existing MOM6 model grids.
 - Use openDataset() to open and read other gridded information.

# Post Release Notes

https://mom6gridtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html is currently tied to an
experimental branch.  Two copies should be tied to the dev and main branch once
PRs are accepted and code is merged.
